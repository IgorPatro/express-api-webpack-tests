## Hi there!

This is basic config to write some express API's powered with Jest TDD and TypeScript compiled with webpack

## Installation

If you want to install this repo and run it locally, you will need first to install all dependencies:

`npm install`

then you are able to run development server which will automaticaly reload with changes:

`npm start`

## Testing

To run tests you just need to write in console:

`npm run test`

If you want to open tests in watch mode write:

`npm run test:watch`
